B4 batch:

Since hibernate is done, we would like to see a working implementation for same.

Please create a student entity class with fields like id, name, emailId, Address and marks.
Address entity with fields like houseNo, city, street, state, pincode.

One to Many relationship between student and Address

Implement dao methods which can:
1)  save a new student, 
2) get all student details //should use secong level caching 
3) get student details for particluar id
4) get students whose marks are greater than 40 //Use query cache for this
5) update student , set marks = +5 , where marks are between 35 and 40. For this use locking technique.
6) Use second level cache by deafult for this project
7) Use bidirectional mapping to map students and address.

If you are facing issues implementing any functionality, let Jayant know. Better if you are able to do it by Monday
