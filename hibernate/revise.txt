What is hibernate framework? Why is it said to be an ORM framework?

1) Map objects to tables
2) Use persistence api for crud operations : save, update, delete, get, load
3) We don't have to load the driver, write sql queries, manage the resultset, do the data transformation. Just focus on business logic when compared to jdbc
4) Hibernate provides a powerful query language (HQL) that is similar to SQL. However, HQL is fully object-oriented and understands concepts like inheritance, polymorphism and association
5) Hibernate is an open source project from Red Hat Community and used worldwide. This makes it a better choice than others because learning curve is small and there are tons of online documentations and help is easily available in forums.
6) Hibernate is easy to integrate with other Java EE frameworks, it’s so popular that Spring Framework provides built-in support for integrating hibernate with Spring applications
7)Hibernate supports lazy initialization using proxy objects and perform actual database queries only when it’s required.
8) Hibernate cache helps us in getting better performance.
9) For database vendor specific feature, hibernate is suitable because we can also execute native sql queries.
